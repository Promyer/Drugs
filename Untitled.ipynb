      "to assess the efficacy of osteogenic protein-1 ( op-1 ) for long bone nonunion . although most fracture heal within a normal period , about 5 % to 10 % do not heal and be classify as delay or nonunion fracture . nonunion and segmental bone loss after fracture , reconstructive surgery , or lesion excision can present complex orthopedic problem , and the multiple surgical procedure often need be associate with patient morbidity and reduce quality of life . many factor contribute to the pathogenesis of a delay union or nonunion fracture , include deficiency of calcium , vitamin d , or vitamin c , and side effect of medication such as anticoagulant , steroid , some anti-inflammatory drug , and radiation . it have be show that smoking interfere with bone repair in several way . incidence of nonunion and delayed union cases : an estimate 5 % to 10 % of fracture do not heal properly and go on to delay union or nonunion . if this overall estimate of incidence be apply to the ontario population , the estimate number of delay union or nonunion in the province would be between 3,863 and 7,725 . treatment of nonunion cases : the treatment of nonunion case be a challenge to orthopedic surgeon . however , the basic principle behind treatment be to provide both mechanical and biological support to the nonunion site . fracture stabilization and immobilization be frequently use with the other treatment modality that provide biological support to the fractured bone . biological support include material that c ould be serve as a source of osteogenic cell ( osteogenesis ) , a stimulator of mesenchymal cell ( osteoinduction ) , or a scaffold-like structure ( osteoconduction ) . the capacity to heal a fracture be a latent potential of the stromal stem cell , which synthesize new bone . this process have be define as osteogenesis . activation of the stem cell to initiate osteogenic response and to differentiate into bone-forming osteoblast be call osteoinduction . these 2 property accelerate the rate of fracture healing or reactivate the ineffective healing process . osteoconduction occur when passive structure facilitate the migration of osteoprogenitor cell , the perivascular tissue , and capillary into these structure . bone grafts and bone graft substitutes : bone graft and bone graft substitute have one or more of the follow component : undifferentiated stem cellsgrowth factorsstructural latticeundifferentiated stem cell be unspecialized , multipotential cell that can differentiate into a variety of specialize cell . they can also replicate themselves . the role of stem cell be to maintain and repair the tissue in which they be reside . a single stem cell can generate all cell type of that tissue . bone marrow be a source of at least 2 kind of stem cell . hematopoietic stem cell that form all type of blood cell , and bone marrow stromal stem cell that have osteogenic property and can generate bone , cartilage , and fibrous tissue . bone marrow have be use to stimulate bone formation in bone defect and case of nonunion fracture . bone marrow can be aspirate from the iliac crest and inject percutaneously with fluoroscopic guidance into the site of the nonunion fracture . the effectiveness of this technique depend on the number and activity of stem cell in the aspirate bone marrow . it may be possible to increase the proliferation and speed differentiation of stem cell by expose them to growth factor or by combine them with collagen . many growth factor and cytokine induce in response to injury be believe to have a considerable role in the process of repair . of the many bone growth factor study , bone morphogenetic ( bmp ) have generate the great attention because of their osteoinductive potential . the bmp that have be most widely study for their ability to induce bone regeneration in human include bmp-2 and bmp-7 ( osteogenic protein ) . human osteogenic protein-1 ( op-1 ) have be c loned and produce with recombinant technology and be free from the risk of infection or allergic reaction . the structural lattice be osteoconductive ; it support the ingrowth of develop capillary and perivascular tissue . three distinct group of structural lattice have be identify : collagen , calcium sulphate , and calcium phosphate . these material can be use to replace a lose segment of bone . grafts used for nonunion : autologous bone graft be generally consider the gold standard and the good material for graft because it contain several element that be critical in promote bone formation , include osteoprogenitor cell , the matrix , and bone morphogenetic protein . the osteoconductive property of cancellous autograft be related to the porosity of bone . the highly porous , scaffold-like structure of the graft allow host osteoblast and host osteoprogenitor cell to migrate easily into the area of the defect and to begin regeneration of bone . source of cancellous bone be the iliac crest , the distal femur , the great trochanter , and the proximal tibia . however , harvest the autologous bone graft be associate with postoperative pain at the donor site , potential injury to the surround artery , nerve , and tissue , and the risk of infection . thus the development of synthetic material with osteoconductive and osteoinductive property that can eliminate the need for harvesting have become a major goal of orthopedic research . allograft be the graft of tissue between individual who be of the same specie but be of a disparate genotype . allograft have osteoconductive and limited osteoinductive property . demineralize bone matrix ( dbm ) be human cortical and cancellous allograft . these product be prepare by acid extraction of allograft bone ,
